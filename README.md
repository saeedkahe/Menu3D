### Hello👋
Welcome to my training.❤️<br>
In this exercise, we come to the important topic of transform.<br>
### first 
<hr>
In the first step, we create the HTML file.<br>
Inside the HTML file, we create our own ul tag. We must be careful to consider a parent for the children. Now we give the parent transform rotate with the desired value.<br>
(It is better to reach your desired values using Inspect.)<br>

### second
<hr>
In the second step, we create our own style file.<br>
I used the styling inside the HTML file here. My suggestion to you is to make a CSS file.<br>
In the second step, we rate the children according to their position.<br>
Now we have to write hover for them.<br>
I chose yellow, you can use any color you like.<br>

### Good luck!😘
